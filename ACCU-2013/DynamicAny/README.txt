This is DynamicAny test application. The application depends on POCO and Boost libraries.

In order to sucesfully build the executable, folowing conditions must be satisfied:

- application directory (the directory where this file resides) must be placed in $POCO_BASE/Foundation/samples directory
- Poco::Foundation library must be built
- Boost library direcotry must be in the path (there is no need to build Boost)
