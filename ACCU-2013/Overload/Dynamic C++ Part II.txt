== Introduction

In this installment of the Dynamic C$$++$$ series of articles, we continue to explore the dynamic solutions in C$$++$$ language. We start with *Boost* `type_erasure`<<Boost.TypeErasure>>, a combination of *Boost.Any* <<Boost.Any>> and *Boost.Function* <<Boost.Function>>, addressing the C$$++$$ runtime polymorphism shortcomings. Next, we look into `Val`, a class at the heart of the *PicklingTools* library <<PicklingTools>> aimed at interaction with Python environment. We conclude with *Facebook*'s `folly` library solution for interfacing the world of web and JSON from C$$++$$ - the `dynamic` class.

== Boost.TypeErasure

According to the author, `type_erasure` is a generalization of *Boost.Any* and *Boost.Function* classes, allowing easy composition of arbitrary type erased operations; it addresses the shortcomings of C$$++$$ runtime polymorphism, in particular:

- intrusiveness
- dynamic memory management
- inability to apply multiple independent concepts to a single object.

Library uses some advanced constructs such as concepts and template metaprogramming constructs from `boost::mpl`. In a similar fashion like `boost::variant` specifying a set of types at construction time that can be contained at runtime, the `type_erasure` library specifies at construction time a set of operations that can be performed on it at runtime. This is achieved through a vector of _concepts_ provided at object declaration site as shown in Listing 1 for an `incrementable` and `ostreamable` object.

.Listing 1
----
any<
    mpl::vector<
        copy_constructible<>,
        typeid_<>,
        incrementable<>,
        ostreamable<>
    >
> x(10);
++x; // incrementable
std::cout << x << std::endl; // ostreamable
----

In the example, `copy_constructible` allows _copying_ and _destruction_ of the object, while `typeid_` provides _run-time type information_ so that `any_cast` can be used; these effectively make `type_erasure any` equivalent to `any` <<Boost.Any>>. Additionally, `incrementable` and `ostreamable` concepts are specified, allowing incrementing and streaming of the value `x`. Operations can have arguments, so replacing `incrementable` _concept_ with `addable`, allows adding of two `any`'s. The functionality is brittle in a subtle way, though - while adding two values of different types will compile, unfortunately it results in undefined behavior at runtime. This problem can be alleviated by specifying `relaxed_match` concept (according to author, recently renamed to a more appropriate `relaxed` name), which causes exception to be thrown. The proper way of dealing with this problem is using _placeholders_, as shown in Listing 2

.Listing 2
----
int array[5];

typedef mpl::vector<
    copy_constructible<_a>,
    copy_constructible<_b>,
    typeid_<_a>,
    addable<_a, _b, _a>
> requirements;

tuple<requirements, _a, _b> t(&array[0], 2);
any<requirements, _a> x(get< 0 > (t) + get< 1 >(t));
// x now holds array + 2
----

Placeholders are used extensively throughout the library. A placeholder is a substitute for a template parameter in a concept. The library automatically replaces all placeholders with the actual wrapped types.

Furthermore, `type_erasure` supports references (both `const` and `non-const`), as well as user-defined _concepts_. Listing 3 demonstrates adding `stringable` _concept_ to `type_erasure`, allowing a `to_string()` member function call syntax directly on an _integer_ value wrapped in `any`. Things can be simplified when implementation and interface are the same (i.e. a member of `type_erasure::any` called `to_string` calls a `to_string` member of the contained type), BOOST_TYPE_ERASURE_MEMBER ``shortcut'' macro can be used.

.Listing 3
----
template<class F, class T>
struct to_string
{
   // conversion function
   static T apply(const F& from, T& to)
   {
     return to = NumberFormatter::format(from);
   }
};

namespace boost {
namespace type_erasure {
   template<class F, class T, class Base> // binding
   struct concept_interface<::to_string<F, T>, Base, F> : Base
   {
      typedef typename rebind_any<Base, T>::type IntType;
      T to_string(IntType arg = IntType())
      {
          return call(::to_string<C, T>(), *this, arg);
      }
}; }

typedef any<to_string<_self, std::string>, _self&> stringable;
int i = 123;
stringable s(i);
std::string str = s.to_string(); // s == "123"
----

Internally, a `void*` _pointer_ points to the held heap-allocated value and a static equivalent of _virtual table_ serves as a _binding_ for attached operations as shown in Listing 4.

.Listing 4
----
// storage
struct storage
{
    storage() {}
    template<class T>
    storage(const T& arg) : data(new T(arg)) {}
    void* data;
};
// binding of concept to actual type
typedef ::boost::type_erasure::binding<Concept> table_type;
// actual storage
::boost::type_erasure::detail::storage data;
                           table_type table;
----

Boost.Type erasure is an interesting and valuable "merger" of `any` and `function` features, providing dynamic-language like features within the confines of standard C++. Implementation is rather complex and use has some non-intuitive weak spots that can quickly get an inexperienced user in a serious trouble. A more robust interface (even if only with _typedef_s provided for most frequently used types) would greatly improve the usability and safety for less experienced users.


== PicklingTools Val

The next reviewed solution to the dynamic typing problem is the *PicklingTools* <<PicklingTools>> Val. The PicklingTools library is an open-source library made up of Python, C++ and Java code allowing cross language communication.  The PicklingTools evolved from a need allowing Python and C$$++$$ to share Python dictionaries across language boundaries.  Many modern applications are built using multiple languages: Python, C$$++$$, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Icon/Unicon. The front-end languages (JavaScript, Python, Lua) tend to be dynamic languages for handling scripting and basic data flow. The back-end languages (C$$++$$, C, Java, FORTRAN) handle the heavy-lifting of fast communications, data I/O and CPU intensive work. In these hybrid system, front-end languages need to communicate with the back-end languages intensively. Dictionaries, supported in some form by most dynamic languages, became the _currency_ of many systems. The *PicklingTools* library solution focuses on the Python dictionary and C$$++$$.

While making Python dictionaries easy to express in C$$++$$ was not a primary goal, given how much users enjoyed the ease of use, the C$$++$$ PicklingTools embraced them wholeheartedly. The goal, then, became to make Python dictionaries as easy to express in C$$++$$ as it was in Python.  

Consider the ease of a dynamic dictionary manipulation in Python shown in Listing 5.

.Listing 5
----
# Create a Python literal
>>> d = { 'a': 1, 'b':2.2, 'c': { 'X':1, 'Y':[1,2,3]  }

>>> print d['a']    # lookup a single key: 'a' -> 1
>>> d['b'] = 3.3     # insert into dict

# Also easy to lookup/insert nested entities
>>> print d['c']['X']   # lookup nested key
>>> d['c']['Y'] = 0     # insert nested
----

Because C++ is a statically-typed language, it requires a compile-time type for all variables. *PicklingTools* use `Val` to indicate a dynamic value. 

.The `Val` Name Rationale
*******************************
Why _Val_ and not something like dynamic or any? Three reasons:

- Everything is, in general, passed by value
- PicklingTools encourage use of valgrind to help ensure quality
- Val is only three letters, which is closer to a dynamic language with no letters for the type.
*******************************

A side-by-side comparison of basic dynamic typing in Python and C$$++$$ using `Val` is shown in Listing 6.

.Listing 6
----
# Python
>>> a = 1
>>> a = 2.2
>>> a = 'three'    # a takes three different types

// C++
Val a = 1;         // overload constructor 
a = 2.2;           // overload op=
a = "three";
----

The *PicklingTools* Val is implemented as a _union_ and a _type-tag_, where the value is constructed using _placement new_ inside the _union_. The destructor has to manually notice which type to destruct (for non-POD types) and explicitly call the correct constructor. The Val is really just a dynamic container, with storage as shown in Listing 7.  

.Listing 7
----
struct Val
{
  // Flags: the ascii typetag, subtype for arrays,
  char tag;
  char subtype;
  char isproxy;
  char pad;
    
  Allocator *a;  // if using shared memory or special allocator

  union
  {
    int_1  s;      // type tag 's'
    int_u1 S;      // type tag 'S'
    int_2  i;      // type tag 'i'
    int_u2 I;      // type tag 'I'
    int_4  l;      // type tag 'l'
    int_u4 L;      // type tag 'L'
    int_8  x;      // type tag 'x'
    int_u8 X;      // type tag 'X'
    real_4 f;      // type tag 'f'
    real_8 d;      // type tag 'd'
    complex_8  F;  // type tag 'F'
    complex_16 D;  // type tag 'D'
    char t[sizeof(Tab)]; // type tag 't', usually 32
    char n[sizeof(Arr)]; // type tag 'n', usually 32
  } u;
};
----

As can be concluded from Listing 7, by design `Val` can only contain certain types, shown in Listing 8.

.Listing 8
----
// POD types
int_1, int_u1, int_2, int_u2, 
int_4, int_u4, int_8, int_u8, 
real_4, real_8, 
complex_8, complex_16, size_t

// Non-POD types
string, None, Tab (like Python dictionary), 
Arr (like Python list)
----

There are no-user defined types by design. This allows library writers to concentrate on making the interface for C++ Python dictionaries as close to Python as possible without worrying about the problems generality brings.

Listing 9 shows how easy it is to construct a Val from basic types and get values out by means of user-defined conversion.

.Listing 9
----
// overload Val constructor on all supported types
Val a = 1;     
Val b = 2.2; 
Val c = "three";
// Get a value out via user-defined conversions
int_u4 i = a;   
----

The user-defined conversions and overloading" are syntactic sugar. Of course, overloaded cast operators direct calls are really just taking advantage of ``syntactic sugar'' for function calls as shown in Listing 10.

.Listing 10
----
Val v = 1;
int_u4 i = v.operator int_u4();
----

The Val supports user-defined conversions for all basic types. If the conversion isn't direct, then the user-defined conversions follow the _Principle of Least Surprise_: convert as C$$++$$ would, example shown in Listing 11.

.Listing 11
----
Val v = 3.14159265;
int_u4 i4 = v; // Which conversion?  As C++ would:
               //  int_u4 i4 = static_cast<int_u4>(3.14159265);
----

If the conversion doesn't make sense, behavior is identical to that in Python - an exception is thrown, see Listing 12.

.Listing 12
----
# Python
>>> a = 3.14159265
>>> i4 = int(a)           # converts to 3
>>> d = dict(a)           # Exception!  doesn't make sense to convert to dict

// C++
Val a = 3.14159265;
int_u4 i4 = a;            // converts to 3
Tab d = i4;               // Compile-time error, can't construct Tab from float
----

The `Val` provides the basic container to support dynamic dictionaries. The C++ `Tab` is equivalent to the Python `dict` (think `Tab == Table`). The keys of the C$$++$$ Tab, as well as the values of the dictionary are `Val`s, allowing us to construct dynamic dictionaries as shown in Listing 13.

.Listing 13
----
# Python
d = {'a':1, 'b':2.2, 'c':'three'}

// C++
Tab d = "{'a':1, 'b':2.2, 'c':'three'}";
----

Note that the C$$++$$ literal is inside a string: the library overloads the constructor of the Tab to take a string which contains the literal. While C++11 has some great new literal constructs, it can't quite mimic Python's syntax.

Literal construction of a Python dictionary is supported using exactly the Python syntax: you can cut-and-paste the Python dictionary literal and paste it into the C++ quotes.  There is a little Python dictionary parser embedded in the Tab class so that it recognizes the same syntax.   Rather than invent a new syntax for literal construction, library leverage the well-known Python syntax.


== Facebook `folly::dynamic`

The Facebook folly::dynamic class is another one in the spectrum of dynamic-typing classes. The class aims to relax the static typing constraints, especially in the _JSON_ format data manipulation scenarios; it provides a runtime dynamically typed value for C++, similar to the way languages with runtime type systems work (e.g. Python). It can hold types from a predetermined set (ints, bools, arrays of other dynamics, etc), similar to `boost::variant` and PicklingTools `Val`, but the syntax is intended to be more akin to using the native type directly.

An example of creating a `dynamic` holding most common types is shown in listing 14. Strings are stored internally as `fbstring`, the Facebook _drop-in_ replacement for `std::string`.

.Listing 14
----
dynamic twelve = 12;
dynamic str = "string"; // fbstring
dynamic nul = nullptr;
dynamic boolean = false;
----

.Facebook String Flavor
*******************************
Facebook `folly::fbstring` is a drop-in replacement for std::string, providing the benefit of significantly increased performance on virtually all important primitives. This is achieved by using a three-tiered storage strategy and cooperating with the memory allocator; fbstring is designed to detect use of jemalloc <<jemalloc>> and cooperate with it to significantly improve speed and memory usage.

[underline]#Storage strategies#

- Small strings ($$<=$$23 chars) are stored in-situ without memory allocation.
- Medium strings (24-255 chars) are stored in malloc-allocated memory and copied eagerly.
- Large strings (>255 chars) are stored in `malloc`-ated memory and copied lazily.

[underline]#Implementation highlights#

- Compatible with `std::string`.
- Thread-safe, reference-counted copy-on-write for large (>255 chars) strings.
- Uses `malloc` instead of allocators.
- Jemalloc-friendly
- The `find()` is implemented using simplified Boyer-Moore algorithm. 
- Offers conversions to and from `std::string`.

Supported architectures are x32 and x64; porting `fbstring` to big-endian architectures would require changes.
*******************************

Library extensively uses C++11 features for both speed and syntactic advantages. For example, as shown in Listing 15, arrays can be initialized with _initializer lists_. This particular feature, however, also imposes a  limitation - `dynamic` has no default constructor. Rationale for this design decision is due to the standard requirement for the expression `dynamic d = {}` to call default constructor. The conflict arises in the default construction either having to result in `d.isArray()` (a) being `false` for the expression `dynamic d = {}` or (b) being true for `dynamic d`. The solution the authors of `folly::dynamic` deemed most appropriate is to entirely disallow the default construction.

.Listing 15
----
dynamic array = { "array ", "of ", 4, " elements" };
assert(array.size() == 4);
dynamic emptyArray = {};
assert(array.empty());
----

Maps from dynamics to dynamics are called objects. As shown in Listing 16, the `dynamic::object` constant is how an empty map from dynamics to dynamics is created. Same listing also shows how `dynamic` objects can be created by using `object::operator()`.

.Listing 16
----
dynamic map = dynamic::object;
map["something"] = 12;
map["another_something"] = map["something"] * 2;

dynamic map2 = dynamic::object("something", 12)("another_something", 24);
----

The internal `dynamic` storage is shown in Listing 17. Types that can be held are: `null`, `Array`, `bool`, `double`, `integer` (64-bit), `Object` and `String`.

.Listing 17
----
enum Type
{
  NULLT,
  ARRAY,
  BOOL,
  DOUBLE,
  INT64,
  OBJECT,
  STRING,
};

// ...

Type type_;
  
union Data 
{
  explicit Data() : nul(nullptr) {}

  void* nul; // void* used instead of std::nullptr_t due to gcc bug
  Array array;
  bool boolean;
  double doubl;
  int64_t integer;
  fbstring string;

  typename std::aligned_storage<
    sizeof(std::unordered_map<int,int>),
    alignof(std::unordered_map<int,int>)
  >::type objectBuffer;
} u_;
----

Examples of object and string construction are shown in Listing 18. Most notably, `ObjectImpl` is not a mere typedef but inherits from hash map; the reason for this to avoid undefined behavior of parameterizing `std::unordered_map` with an incomplete type.

.Listing 18
----
struct dynamic::ObjectImpl : std::unordered_map<dynamic, dynamic> {};

// ...

inline dynamic::dynamic(ObjectMaker (*)())
  : type_(OBJECT)
{
  new (getAddress<ObjectImpl>()) ObjectImpl();
}

inline dynamic::dynamic(char const* s)
  : type_(STRING)
{
  new (&u_.string) fbstring(s);
}
